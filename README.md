# ImageSegmentation (In progress)

We attempt to impliment various image segmentation techniques to better analyze the morphological features of atomic force microscopy measurments of cells. However, these technique could be used for other microscopy methods such as SNOM, elasticity, etc.

## Trainable Random Forest
In the uitlsRF.py we find an implemantion of  the trainable random forest technique as shown in https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_trainable_segmentation.html .
